# The Redlining Lab is digitizing the real redlining maps. 
Recent digitizations of the Homeowners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) “redlining” maps for cities across the country are an instructive but lacking tool. The HOLC was responsible for only underwater loans during a brief bailout period between 1935-1938. The Federal Housing Administration’s mortgage insurance program, which was active from 1938 – 196X was the public agency responsible for the bulk of the “redlining” in our country’s history.

We are a project to estimate the real impacts of historical redlining through the collection of loan and block-level redlining data across the country.
